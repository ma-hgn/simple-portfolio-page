            I'm Mark, a {age}-year-old software developer from Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
            While pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Goethe-University in Frankfurt, I also work on various <a href="#projects">Â«projectsÂ»</a> in my free time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since I enjoy learning new things to become the best coder i can be, I am familiar with a fairly wide range of software-development paradigms, -languages and -tooling and am constantly working on improving my <a href="#skills">Â«skillsetÂ»</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When coding, my main concerns are the speed of the finished product and concision of the source code, which is why my projects are preferably written in compiled low-level languages such as Rust or C. I can also adapt my knowledge to modern web-development stacks. The page you are reading, for example, is written in TypeScript using React.
        </p>
        <p>
            Want to get to know me better or work together?
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="#contact">Â«Get in touchÂ»</a>. I am looking forward to it.
